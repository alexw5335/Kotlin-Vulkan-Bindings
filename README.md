# Kotlin Vulkan bindings

Autogenerated bindings for the Vulkan graphics API in Kotlin, plus native memory management 
utilities.

This library does not use [LWJGL](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3). It is 
instead intended to be an alternative to LWJGL's Vulkan bindings that takes 
advantage of Kotlin-specific features. Due to the use of Kotlin's inline 
classes and functions, this library is *cannot reasonably be used from Java*.

All Vulkan bindings are automatically generated from the 
[Vulkan API registry](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers/tree/master/registry). 
Specifically, from the registry/vk.xml file.

## Modules
The library is separated into gradle submodules:

- **core**: Native memory management and platform-specific native library loading
- **vulkan-bindings**: Raw (but mostly type-safe), autogenerated bindings for Vulkan.
- **codegen**: Code generation for vulkan-bindings and core. Should not be used as a dependency.
- **vulkan-wrapper**: A thin wrapper around vulkan-bindings.
- **window**: A simple platform-agnostic windowing system.
- **samples**: Testing for vulkan-wrapper.

Only **core** and **vulkan-bindings** are needed in order to use the library.

## Overview

This library encourages stack allocation wherever possible. Native stack allocation cannot be 
used from Java, so memory stacks are simulated using the 
[MemStack](kvb-core/src/main/kotlin/kvb/core/memory/MemStack.kt) class.
