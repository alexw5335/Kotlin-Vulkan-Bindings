Wrapper limitations:
	- For all applications, there is a global instance and device.
	- There is a global physical device, however, physical device commands
	may take other physical devices for the purpose of choosing the global one.
	- Many extensions and advanced features will not be supported at all. Their structs
	and commands will simply not be included in the bindings.
	- Each Pipeline has a unique PipelineLayout that will be destroyed along with it.
	- Each DescriptorSet has a unique DescriptorSetLayout that will be destroyed when the
	DescriptorSet is freed.
	- All commands are made global, not requiring the global instance nor device to
	be specified. All physical device commands have two versions, one for the global
	physical device and the other for a specified one.

vk_commands.h
	- Holds a global instance, physical device, and device.
	- Non-global physical device functions are postfixed to distinguish them from global ones.

- All instance, physical device, and device information is made global.
- In order to switch physical devices, an application restart is required, e.g.
to switch full-screen monitors.
